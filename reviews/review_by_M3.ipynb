    "## Task Summary\n",
    "My task was to write the `generate_means_sequence()`and `visualize_data()` functions. For the `generate_means_sequence()` function, I had to use the `extract_answers_sequence()` function provided by Team Member 1 to process the data from `collated_answers.txt`.by Team Member 2, calculate the mean value of each questions, and output a list of 100 floats. For the `visualize_data（）` function, I have to visualizes the means sequence as a scatter plot (if n=1), and create a line plot (if n=2) with all lines for each individual answer based on the files from data folder."

    "## Code Review\n",
    "The code works by splitting the combined answers from `collated_answers.txt` into individual blocks, and then generating a list of numeric answers for each respondent using the `extract_answers_sequence` function provided by Team Member 1. I used the regular expression module (re) to split the combined answer file, since each respondent's block is separated by a line containing *. Using `re.split()` is more robust than a simple `split(\"*\")`, because it can delete extra spaces or line breaks and so on. This is important because M1’s function expects each block to follow a specific format with a consistent number of lines. I then created some temporary files to store blocks because the function by Member 1 can only read files rather than a string. After gathering all 25 answer lists, finally I created the loops for mean value calculation for each question, ignoring unanswered ones.  \n",
    "The `visualize_data` function reads and extracts 25 respondent answer files from the `data` folder using M1's function. If n == 1, it calculates the mean of each question and plots it as a scatter plot. If n == 2, it plots each respondent's full answer sequence as a line.  \n",
    "To improve readability, I fine-tuned visual settings and used tight_layout() and xticks(); To make the visual outputs easier to access and review, I saved the generated plots into the `output` folder.\n"
